qtLogout - easy app to logout your openbox.
It's experimental software, I'm learning C++ :)

TODO:
- Remove hard coded dbus-send commands and repleace it with dbus c++ implementation.
- Gracefully shutdown all apps during exit process

INSTALATION EXAMPLE
- Run "qmake INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr" <- You should set this path, because default is /usr/local.
- Next "make" <- If you have more than one cpu cores, You can use "-jN" option, where N is you cpu cores number +1.
- Then "make install" for install in your system.

P.S. Sorry for my poor english.
